                French fries can be made from various varieties of potatoes, though Russets are generally preferred. In addition, sweet potatoes are sometimes used. The potatoes are cut into different shapes, such as wedges, curls, or, most commonly, thin strips. After the optional but recommended step of blanching, the pieces are dried and then typically fried in a deep fryer. The oil causes french fries to be high in fat, which is linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Flavouring with salt also poses risks to the heart. Amid growing health concerns, many fast-food chains, including McDonald’s, stopped using oil that contains trans fat in the early 21st century. To avoid or limit the use of oil, french fries can also be baked in an oven or made in an air fryer.

                Hamburgers are customarily eaten as a sandwich, between two halves of a round bun. Mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, and other condiments, along with garnishes of lettuce, onion, tomato, and sliced cucumber pickle, constitute the customary dressing. In the variation known as the cheeseburger, a slice of cheese is melted over the patty. The patty itself is often seasoned or augmented with chopped onions, spices, or bread crumbs before cooking.
